# WebApplication1
It is a Job Search Application i.e basically used for post, search and approve jobs. There are 3 roles in this apllication i.e Admin who can approve, cancel or delete the posted jobs, Job Provider who can provide or post jobs and Job seeker who can search for jobs and apply for jobs. I have used Microsoft SQL Server & SQL Server Management Studio for database management.
